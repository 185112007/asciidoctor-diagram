= Asciidoctor-diagram Examples

This directory contains a number of example files that illustrate how to use the asciidoctor-diagram extension.
Asciidoctor 0.1.4 does not support loading extensions via the command line.
In order to process the examples correctly you should use the `build-example.rb` script.
This wraps the regular `asciidoctor` command line tool and automatically loads the asciidoctor-diagram extension.
